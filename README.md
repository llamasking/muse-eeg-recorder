# muse-eeg-recorder

Just an example script from the [MuseLSL](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl) repo that I modified to record delta waves and save all readings to a csv file.

## Usage

Get a MuseLSL stream running then run neurofeedback.py to record EEG to a csv file.

Make sure to rename or move the csv files between runs. Neurofeedback.py will overwrite any existing files on run.
